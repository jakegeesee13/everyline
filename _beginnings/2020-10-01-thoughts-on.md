11:43a

i think i'll be putting time on each text, as without it i find that, though the posts may appear chronological, there's no way of knowing if they were concieved at noon or midnight

except i suppose midnight might be the next day

but was my rant of tons of posts in the morning at night? what was on my mind?

does it matter?

what's real, etc
