I AM HERE I AM HERE I AM HERE I AM HERE I AM HERE I AM HERE I AM

here,

i feel as though the weight is lighter, with You

i understand the process, the beauty in making, the beauty in repeating, and the beauty in change ------- let all things be new

i do not know where this will go, but it will be alive in some way

just as i am alive,

just as i am here
